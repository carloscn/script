The Advanced own by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]),[5] is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.


In the United States, AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001.[6] This announcement followed a five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable.
